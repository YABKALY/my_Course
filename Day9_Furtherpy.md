# Further on Python
## Functions
* A function is a block of code that performs a specific
task.
* Suppose, you need to create a program to create a
circle and color it. You can create two functions to solve
this problem:
* create a circle function
* create a color function
* Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes
our program easy to understand and reuse.
# Types of function
* There are two types of function in Python programming:
* Standard library functions - These are built-in functions in
Python that are available to use.
* Almost all keywords are functions
* User-defined functions - We can create our own functions
based on our requirements.
# Creating Functions
Syntax: It have body like if else statements also have
body.
* Example: 
 Functions have to be called to word. Thing functions like some skilled person, plumbers
can do water pipe problems, their specific task is fixing broken pipes. So, if i need to fix my
plumber what do i do? I just call them right! | => SO python functions also have to be
called
* We have 2 functions
* gtst
* Nathan
* Both do different
tasks.
* We have called their
name so they are on
the output
## Function Arguments
* They are used to take value while calling and insert it inside the function.
* The function takes fname & name
as a variable for the function.
## Return statement
* A Python function may or may not return a value.
* If we want our function to return some value to a function call, we use
the return statement.
* As i told you every things are functions on python
* So print() is function also input() is len(), everything
* When we do we are calling the function and giving it an argument.
* You can give default values too
## Quiz coding.
* Write a code that can replace this pow() keyword. It accepts 2 arguments a number and its
power. It u do pow(4,2) => it gives 16 , means the power.
1) Create A function
2) Accept to arguments
3) Do a calculation to power
4) Return the value
5) Call the function and print it.
## Recursion
* Recursion is process of defining something in terms of itself.
* In Python, we know that a function can call other functions. It is even possible for the
function to call itself. These types of construct are termed as recursive functions.
## Advantages of Recursion
1. Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.
2. A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using
recursion.
3. Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested
iteration.
## Disadvantages of Recursion
1. Sometimes the logic behind recursion is hard to follow through.
2. Recursive calls are expensive (inefficient) as they take up a lot of memory and time.
3. Recursive functions are hard to debug.
Anonymous / lambda Function
* If function doesnt have name it is called lambda function / Anonymous
* If you have 1 line code to return you dont need to def a function,
* a lambda function is a special type of function without the function name.
* Syntax:
* We use lambda keyword instead of def
## Function takers function
* Filter, map & reduce takes a function as an argument.
## Filter Function
* Filters are used to filter or search some function from sequences
## Map function
* Used to do some operations on Sequences
* If you want to do a doubling equations on a list of numbers.
## Append
* Append used to add some value to a list.
# Object-Oriented Programming / OOP
* Python is an object oriented programming. This means mores things on python are
objects.
* Objects are anythings which can have action and name.
* Objects have attributes(properties) and methods(action or functions)
* Example : My COmputer
* Attribute: name,size,cpu,ram…
* Behaviour: Running games, playing music, displaying texts…
## Python class and object
* Class is simply a place where we create our Object’s attribute and behaviour in blueprint
* a class is a blueprint for that object.
* Syntax:
* After you create the Blueprint, now you can create the objects
## Creating Objects
* You can Create many Objects based on 1 class. | Here we created Object
called Nathan_Computer
* Syntax:
* Var = classname()
* Var.attribute = “value”
## Lets check the type() of our object
* When we check Our type it is similar with type of int, both
are classes,
* ‘a’ and ‘Nathan_Computer’ are objects
* computer and int are classes
Giving Behaviours == Creating Methods
* Functions are called methods on OOP
* Syntax on calling
* classname .method(object)
* Creating a Behaviour run, which is 1 behaviour of my
computer. And have parameter of ‘self’
* Self is the object name on OOP you have to declare it
# Python Constructors
* Earlier we assigned a default value to a class attribute,
However, we can also initialize values using the constructors.
Here, __init__() is the constructor function that is called whenever
* a new object of that class is instantiated.
The constructor above initializes the value of the name attribute. We
have used the self.name to refer to the name attribute of the bike1
object.
* If we use a constructor to initialize values inside a class, we need
to pass the corresponding value during the object creation of the
class.
## Python Inheritance
* Is a way of creating new class with
some properties of existing class.
* Syntax:
* class newclass(oldclass):
## Python Encapsulation
* Encapsulation is Feature of OOP, That refers to
bundling of attributes and methods inside a
single class
## Package installing
* As we have seen package installing on our linux tutorial
* We use pip to install tools so, on terminal
pip install packagename
## Package using
* On python, there are a lot of packages to use them, we simply
* Each packages have their own classes and methods so we have to do more studies about
those packages.
* Here, we imported sys package and
from that package we added the method
argv, and creating an object ‘a’
